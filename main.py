## GoChurch Community Server

A comprehensive church community platform built with FastAPI, featuring:

### üèõÔ∏è **Core Features**
- **Integer-based Architecture** - Enhanced performance with integer primary keys
- **Church Management** - Directory of churches with contact information
- **Identity Verification** - Photo-based verification system with admin review
- **Discussion Boards** - Organized discussion boards for community engagement
- **Post & Comment System** - Rich content sharing with nested comments
- **Action Logging** - Track user interactions (views, likes, bookmarks, reports)

### üîê **Security**
- Integer primary keys with auto-increment
- Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection protection with SQLAlchemy ORM
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

### üìä **Database Schema**
Based on PostgreSQL with integer primary keys, featuring:
- Users with admin/blocked status
- User profiles linked to churches
- Identity verification workflow
- Hierarchical board/post/comment structure
- Comprehensive action logging

### üöÄ **Getting Started**
1. Create a user: `POST /users/`
2. Create a profile: `POST /users/profiles/`
3. Create a church: `POST /churches/`
4. Create a board: `POST /boards/`
5. Start posting: `POST /boards/{board_id}/posts`

### üìù **API Usage**
All endpoints use integer identifiers. Example ID: `1`

For detailed examples and usage patterns, see the individual endpoint documentation below.
